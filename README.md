# Amazon Vine Analsyis 
## Overview 
For this challenge, we were tasked with finding potential poor data on five star reviews for furniture reviews bought on Amazon. In order to do this, we extracted three variables from the data sets, see below. 
* Number of reviews
* Reviews with five stars
* Percentage of five star reviews

Results from our analysis are broken out below.

* % of five star reviews paid 

## Summary 
The results reported above can skew one who is reviewing them. Total percentage of unpaid reviews is higher at 54% (rounded), but the total sample size is much smaller when comparing versus the unpaid reviews data. It is tough to draw a firm conclusion on this data with the sample sets being very skewed in terms of size. 

My recommendation would be to make sure the data sets are similar in size and to include total cost of each item. From there, we can group the objects by costs and further analyze where the true reviews are coming at.
